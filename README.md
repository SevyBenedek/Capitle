# Capitle
This is a geography game. You are either given a country or a capital and you have to guess the other.

Please dowload the two given .txt files as they contain the necessary data. Their names are self-explanatory

Note that this is the start of this project and is being written by an absolute amateur, only i upload it so
that people with similar ambitions may look at the source code and get some ideas.
Feel free to give feedback, as without it I can not improve it that well. More eyes see more.

Thank you for looking my way and Happy Coding!
